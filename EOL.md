# Slackware ARM accessories directory (End-of-Life releases)
Much like the main page, this page will act as a directory for user-contributed links to hardware either required by, or otherwise benefitting the user experience of, Slackware ARM. The only difference is that this page exclusively targets releases that are EOL (End-of-Life). Once a currently-supported release becomes EOL, it will be moved from the main page over to this one.

## History
Slackware ARM originally started in 2002 under the name ARMedslack, acting as a port of Slackware Linux to the ARM CPU architecture. ARMedslack remained in -current form until 2007 when the first stable release, ARMedslack 11.0, released.

At the time, ARMedslack only officially supported two machines: the Acorn StrongARM RiscPC, and experimentally the Castle Technologies Iyonix PC, though users reported being able to run the OS on other devices as well with some effort (such is true for any release of ARMedslack or Slackware ARM). In 2009, the project was declared an official port of Slackware by Patrick Volkerding, the creator, lead maintainer, and BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) of the main Slackware project. It wouldn't be until 14.0 that the project would fully transition to the name Slackware ARM. Incidentally, during this time, ARMedslack did not recieve either a 12.0 or 12.1 release for stability reasons, as the project was undergoing a rewrite. Since 13.1, however, releases of ARMedslack/Slackware ARM have stayed closely in tandem with their contemporaries for x86.

### Releases
Though these releases are all EOL, some people still choose to run them for various reasons, such as nostalgia, curiosity, or because they lack hardware supported by newer versions, to name but a few. Here, they can provide links to hardware that will aid in the experience of running these old and dusty versions so that other intrepid explorers of vintage Slackware ARM can benefit from this documented knowledge.
