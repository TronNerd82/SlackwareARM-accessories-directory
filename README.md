# SlackwareARM accessories directory
A user-contributed directory of links to purchase accessory hardware required by or otherwise benefiting the user experience of Slackware ARM

## The bare minimum recommended hardware:
* Your single-board computer of choice and its according power supply
* A USB multi-card reader ( EXAMPLE: https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-Windows-Surface-Chromebook/dp/B01EFPX9XA )
* A USB-to-serial adapter ( ideally must use a PL2303 chip; others may work, but the Slackware ARM project has only tested this one )
* A USB-to-SATA cable of some kind ( EXAMPLE: https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-External-Converter-Transfer-OS-Independent/dp/B00HJZJI84/ )
* A 2.5" SATA SSD; your choice of size and brand ( a HDD can also work, but must use external power in most cases )
* A real-time clock setup for your machine, if necessary ( some devices like the Raspberry Pi don't include a RTC, so time doesn't stay synced - follow the Slackware ARM install guides to deal with this issue )

Other items can be used, such as NVMe drives if the hardware supports it, and some devices like the USB-to-serial adapter are unnecessary if they don't fit your needs. Just know that such setups are TECHNICALLY unsupported by the Slackware ARM project, though many users will have little to no issue using such varied setups. Your mileage may vary.

## How to contribute
  Start a pull request with your edits of the README.md file. Include (on a new line below the bottom link) one or more links to the accessories you'd like added to the directory.
  You must give the name of the product, followed by the link itself enclosed in parentheses ( like this ). Then add a section in brackets [ like this ] with the phrase "contributed by 'your GitHub username'" so proper credit can be given.
  I don't check GitHub as often as I should, so your contributions, valued as they are, may not be added right away, but I'll certainly try to add them in a timely fashion.
